3.6.1.1	AZURE SETUP
The initial step is to configure Azure as follows: 
1.	Registered a subscription using DreamSpark
2.	Created a Resource Group
3.	Created a UniSurvey App Service
4.	Created a UniSurveyWebAPI App Service 
5.	Created a UniSurvey Database
6.	Created a UniSurveyIdentity Database

Deploying the Application 
------------------------------

After successfully creating all the resources mentioned in the aforementioned section, both the UniSurvey.Client and UniSurvey.WebAPI solutions were deployed to Microsoft Azure. 
Prior to deploying the application, the project needs to be properly setup and the application must be built. More details are available in the readme.txt file committed with the solution and it is also available in Appendix B. 

These are the most important steps required to deploy the application to Azure: 

1.	Build the Solution
2.	Open Command Prompt, Navigate to the UniSurvey.Client project and type:
		- npm i
		- gulp build
3.	Right click on UniSurvey.Client and click Publish Web App, then follow these steps:
		- Validate the Connection
		- Select Configuration Settings
		- Publish
4.	Right click on UniSurvey.WebAPI and click Publish, then follow these steps:
		- Validate the Connection
		- Select Configuration Settings
	 	- Publish

If all steps were successful, the latest version of the application should now be publicly available at:
		- Client - http://unisurvey.azurewebsites.net/
